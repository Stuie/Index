<strong>Index has been deprecated</strong>

# Index

Index is a small Windows utility that allows you to launch applications and documents in just a few quick keypresses. It is inspired by Alfred on OSX.

The Windows key in Windows 10 covers almost all functionality that was intended to be offered by Index, and so active development has ceased.
